- **Running the entire script at once may produce messy output. It is recommended to run and learn the code topic-wise.**
- **Before learning built-in data structures(1-5) in python , a basic idea is needed on variables in python.**
### 💡 Suggestion:
- **In the era of AI , taking too much time for learning code syntaxes is not required. Keep the basic idea , and try to solve problem more and more.**
- **Problem Sources : Leetcode, HackerRank etc.**
